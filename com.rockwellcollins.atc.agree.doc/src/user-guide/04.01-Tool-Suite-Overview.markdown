## Tool Suite Overview{#sec:tool_suite_overview}

@fig:agree_osate_tool_suite shows an overview of the AGREE/OSATE tool suite. As presented
in the figure, OSATE is installed as an Eclipse plugin that serves as
the IDE for creating AADL models. AGREE runs as a plugin inside OSATE
that provides both a language (AADL annex to annotate the models with
assume-guarantee behavioral contracts) and a tool (for compositional
verification of the contracts reside in AADL models). AGREE translates
an AADL model and its contract annotations into Lustre and then queries
the JKind model checker to perform the verification. JKind invokes a
backend Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver (e.g., Yices or Z3)
to validate if the guarantees are valid in the compositional setting.
