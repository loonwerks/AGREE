## Installation{#sec:agree_osate_installation}

Installing the AGREE/OSATE Tool Suite consists of four steps, described
in each of the following sections.

### Install OSATE

Binary releases of the OSATE tool suite for different platforms are
available at
[OSATE Releases](http://osate.org/osate-releases.html).
Choose the most
recent version of OSATE that is appropriate for your platform.
At the time of writing this document, there are binary tar ball
installations for 64-bit Linux and Apple MAC OSX and
binary ZIP installations for 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows.

Once the .zip file is downloaded, all that is required is to unzip it
into a location in the file system. One candidate location for Windows
is C:\\apps\\osate, but any location in the file system that is
write-accessible is fine. After expanding the .zip file, navigate to the
osate.exe file and double-click it. The splash screen shown in @fig:osate_splash_screen
should appear, and OSATE should begin loading:

![OSATE Splash Screen](../../media/image15.png){#fig:osate_splash_screen}

If OSATE loads successfully, continue to the next step in the
installation process. If not, and you are running Windows, the most
likely culprit involves mismatches between the 32-bit and 64-bit version
of OSATE and the bit-level of the Windows OS. Please check to see
whether the version of OSATE matches the bit-level of your version of
Windows OS. If running Windows 7, this information can be found in the
System Control Panel as shown below in @fig:windows_version_information. Note that this
information is also required for downloading the correct version of the
SMT Solver in the next installation step.

### Install the SMT Solver

Either one of the following SMT solvers can be used as the underlying
symbolic solver invoked by the JKind model checker: Yices from SRI, or
Z3 from Microsoft, Inc.

To download Yices, navigate to
[Yices Install](http://yices.csl.sri.com/)
and download the version of Yices appropriate for your platform.

To download Z3, navigate to
[Z3 Releases](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases)
and download the version of Z3 appropriate for your platform.

Either tool must be unzipped and placed in a directory somewhere in the
file system. Then this directory must be added to the system path. For
directions on how to add directories to your path, please see
[How to permanently set $PATH on Linux/Unix?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux),
or see
[Add to the PATH on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion](http://architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/#.VszAv_krJph)
for Mac OS.

To add directories to your system path in Windows, first navigate to the
System Control Panel and choose the "Advanced system settings" button on
the left side of the panel. The system properties dialog will appear.
Choose the "Advanced" tab in the dialog as shown in @fig:system_properties_dialog, then
click "Environment variables".

![System Properties Dialog Box](../../media/image17.png){#fig:system_properties_dialog width=60%}

The environment variables dialog box is shown in @fig:environment_variables_dialog.

![Environment Variables Dialog Box](../../media/image18.png){#fig:environment_variables_dialog width=60%}

In order to make the application available to all user accounts choose
the PATH environment variable in the "System variables" section and
click "Edit…". This will bring up a text edit box, as seen in @fig:system_variable_edit_dialog.
If the existing path string in the text edit box does not end with a
semicolon (‘;’), add a semicolon first, then append the path to the SMT
solver’s "bin" directory, and click "OK" on the dialogs. The bin
directory for the Yices tool is underneath the main Yices directory,
e.g., C:\\Apps\\
yices-2.4.2-x86\_64-pc-mingw32-static-gmp\\yices-2.4.2\\bin. The bin
directory for the Z3 tool is underneath the main z3 directory, e.g.,
C:\\Apps\\z3-4.4.1-x64-win\\z3-4.4.1-x64-win\\bin.

![System Variable Text Edit Box](../../media/image19.png){#fig:system_variable_edit_dialog width="3.4586329833770777in" height="1.5584689413823272in"}

To test whether Yices has been correctly installed on either Windows or
Linux, open up a command prompt window and type: yices --version. A
version number for Yices matching the installed version should be
displayed.

To test whether z3 has been correctly installed on either Windows or
Linux, open up a command prompt window and type: z3 -version. A version
number for Z3 matching the installed version should be displayed.

### Install the JKind Model Checker

Download the latest release of jKind at:
<https://github.com/agacek/jkind/releases> and unzip it into a location
in the file system. Place the directory containing jkind.jar on your
path using the same technique that was described for installing yices.

To test whether JKind has been successfully installed, open a new
command window and type "jkind". You should see something like the
following:

~~~
usage: jkind [options] <input>
-excel generate results in Excel format
-help print this message
-induct_cex generate inductive counterexamples
-interval generalize counterexamples using interval analysis
-n <arg> maximum depth for bmc and k-induction (default: 200)
-no_bmc disable bounded model checking
-no_inv_gen disable invariant generation
-no_k_induction disable k-induction
-pdr_max <arg> maximum number of PDR parallel instances (0 to disable PDR)
-read_advice <arg> read advice from specified file
-scratch produce files for debugging purposes
-smooth smooth counterexamples (minimal changes in input values)
-solver <arg> SMT solver (default: yices, alternatives: cvc4, z3,
yices2, mathsat, smtinterpol)
-support find a set of support and reduce invariants used
-timeout <arg> maximum runtime in seconds (default: 100)
-version display version information
-write_advice <arg> write advice to specified file
-xml generate results in XML format
-xml_to_stdout generate results in XML format on standard out

C:\apps >
~~~

### Install AGREE

Download the latest release of AGREE from
[SMACCM Releases](https://github.com/smaccm/smaccm/releases)
and unzip it into a location
in the file system. Unzipping the file should create a directory called
"plugins" containing a set of .jar files. Then start OSATE if haven’t
already, go to Help-&gt;Installation Details, and in the "Installed
Software" click on AGREE and uninstall the plugin. After uninstall the
default AGREE that comes with OSATE, go in to the OSATE/plugins folder
and delete the three .jar files that start with
"com.rockwellcollins.atc.agree". Then copy all the .jar files from the
plugin folder of the AGREE’s latest release into OSATE/plugins folder.
@fig:osate_plugins_directory shows a screen capture of the OSATE/plugins folder after
copying the .jar files that come with AGREE release v2.2.0.0.

![OSATE/plugins Directory with .jar Files Replaced](../../media/image20.png){#fig:osate_plugins_directory .class width=90%}

To test whether AGREE has been correctly installed, start OSATE. If it
has been correctly installed, an AGREE menu should appear in OSATE, as
shown in @fig:agree_install_test.

**Note**: If Yices version 2.X.X (e.g., 2.4.2) is used, select "Yices 2"
in OSATE "Window" menu -&gt; "Preferences" -&gt; "Agree" -&gt;
"Analysis" -&gt; SMT Solver, as shown in @fig:smt_solver_selection. Users can also
adjust the timeout and maximum depth for k-induction to use in the
"Analysis" configuration dialog.
