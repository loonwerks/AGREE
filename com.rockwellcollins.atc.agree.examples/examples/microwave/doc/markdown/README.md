# Microwave

The Microwave example is a multi-layer model used in as an exercise for
students in an AGREE tutorial.  It models mode logic, display, control, and
output behaviors and builds on these to illustrate top level safety
properties regarding operation.  As such, many of the intermediate
specification statements are left as work for the student.  Users are
encouraged to start with the given model and develop behavior specifications
that build the system to meet the top-level safety properties.
